    <h1>Understanding Stucco</h1>
    <p>
      Stucco is one of the most durable and attractive exterior finishes when installed correctly.
      This guide explains the benefits of stucco, what quality installation looks like, and what
      homeowners should know before choosing a contractor.
    </p>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>What Is Stucco?</h2>
    <p>
      Stucco is a cement-based exterior finish applied in layers to create a durable,
      weather-resistant surface. It is commonly used on residential and commercial buildings
      throughout Ontario because of its strength, clean appearance, and long lifespan when
      installed properly.

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Why Proper Installation Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Stucco performance depends heavily on preparation and installation. Proper surface
      preparation, moisture control, curing time, and finishing techniques all play a role in
      preventing cracking or long-term damage. When installed correctly, stucco performs
      extremely well in Ontario’s climate.
    </p>
  </section>

   <section class="section">
  <h2>What Proper Stucco Installation Looks Like</h2>
  <p>
    A quality stucco system is built in layers. Each layer protects your home
    from moisture, cracking, and long-term damage. When steps are skipped or
    rushed, problems usually appear within a few years.
  </p>

    <div class="card guide-text">
      <h3>Proper Stucco Layers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Sheathing & Framing</strong> — Structural base of the wall.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Weather Barrier</strong> — Prevents moisture from entering the home.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Metal Lath / Mesh</strong> — Allows stucco to bond properly.</li>
        <li><strong>4. Scratch & Base Coat</strong> — Strength layer that prevents cracking.</li>
        <li><strong>5. Finish Coat</strong> — Final texture and color.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="small">
        Proper curing time between layers is critical for durability and
        preventing future cracks.

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Risks of Poor Stucco Work</h2>
    <p>
      Most stucco problems are not caused by the material itself but by improper installation
      practices. Common issues include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Cracking caused by poor preparation or rushed application</li>
      <li>Moisture problems due to incorrect sealing or flashing</li>
      <li>Uneven texture or poor blending on repairs</li>
      <li>Premature deterioration from improper materials</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Choosing an experienced contractor who focuses on preparation and proper technique helps
      prevent these issues.

  <section class="section">
  <h2>Common Stucco Mistakes That Cause Problems Later</h2>
  <p>
    Many stucco issues don’t appear immediately. Problems often show up years
    later when moisture gets trapped or materials were installed incorrectly.
  </p>

  <div class="grid3">
    <div class="card feature">
      <h3>Skipping Proper Prep</h3>
      <p>
        Poor surface preparation or missing moisture barriers can lead to
        water damage behind the stucco system.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card feature">
      <h3>Thin Base Coats</h3>
      <p>
        Applying coats too thin or too quickly increases cracking and reduces
        long-term durability.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card feature">
      <h3>Rushed Installation</h3>
      <p>
        Stucco requires curing time between layers. Rushing the process often
        leads to early failure.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card feature">
      <h3>Poor Mesh Installation</h3>
      <p>
        Incorrect mesh overlap weakens the system and causes cracks around
        windows and corners.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card feature">
      <h3>No Proper Drainage</h3>
      <p>
        Without proper flashing and drainage paths, moisture can become trapped
        behind the wall.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card feature">
      <h3>Cheap Materials</h3>
      <p>
        Lower-quality materials may look good at first but fail much sooner
        under Canadian weather conditions.
