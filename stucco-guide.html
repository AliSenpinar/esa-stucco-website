    <h1>Understanding Stucco</h1>
    <p>
      Stucco is one of the most durable and attractive exterior finishes when installed correctly.
      This guide explains the benefits of stucco, what quality installation looks like, and what
      homeowners should know before choosing a contractor.

    <h2>What Is Stucco?</h2>
    <p>
      Stucco is a cement-based exterior finish applied in layers to create a durable,
      weather-resistant surface. It is commonly used on residential and commercial buildings
      throughout Ontario because of its strength, clean appearance, and long lifespan when
      installed properly.

    <h2>Why Proper Installation Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Stucco performance depends heavily on preparation and installation. Proper surface
      preparation, moisture control, curing time, and finishing techniques all play a role in
      preventing cracking or long-term damage. When installed correctly, stucco performs
      extremely well in Ontario’s climate.

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Risks of Poor Stucco Work</h2>
    <p>
      Most stucco problems are not caused by the material itself but by improper installation
      practices. Common issues include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Cracking caused by poor preparation or rushed application</li>
      <li>Moisture problems due to incorrect sealing or flashing</li>
      <li>Uneven texture or poor blending on repairs</li>
      <li>Premature deterioration from improper materials</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Choosing an experienced contractor who focuses on preparation and proper technique helps
      prevent these issues.
